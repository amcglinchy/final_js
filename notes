3 different filters

Ownership
Job TYPE
Job STATUS


if job status is checked then check the value, and show those on the map 

check what filters have been checked 
if job status is checked alone then run the job status function
if job type is checked alone then run the job type function 
if job status and job type are checked then run the combined function 

when someone clicks one filter it applies that, but if they click another
it also applies that on top of the previous filter, but we need to clear the
previous one and just run the double one
